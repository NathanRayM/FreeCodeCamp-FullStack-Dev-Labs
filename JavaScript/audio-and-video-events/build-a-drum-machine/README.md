**Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**File Structure:**

```
build-a-drum-machine/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file with structure
├── style.css    # Styles for the page layout
├── script.js    # JavaScript for functionality
└── README.md    # This file
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to `JavaScript/audio-and-video-events/build-a-drum-machine/`.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Enter markdown input get the raw HTML and an HTML preview

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Implemented event handling for both mouse clicks and keyboard input (click, keydown)
- Controlled HTML5 audio playback using JavaScript (play(), currentTime, volume)
- Traversed the DOM to access child and parent elements
- Dynamically updated UI text using textContent
- Used string manipulation to format and display element IDs
- Managed application state with boolean flags (e.g., power on/off)
- Applied conditional logic to enable/disable functionality
- Built interactive UI controls (toggle switch, volume slider)
- Reinforced accessibility concepts using semantic structure and attributes
- Gained experience structuring JavaScript for a larger interactive project
