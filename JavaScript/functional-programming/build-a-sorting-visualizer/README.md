# Build a Sorting Visualizer

**Description:**  
The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts a sequence of integers by comparing couples of adjacent elements starting from the beginning of the sequence. If the first element is greater than the second one, it swaps them. Then, it proceeds with the following couple. When the last element of the sequence is reached, it starts a new cycle from the beginning of the sequence, and repeats the process until the elements are sorted. The algorithm stops after one cycle completes with no swaps.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

**File Structure:**

```
build-a-sorting-visualizer/
├── index.html   # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css   # Styling for layout and visual highlights
├── script.js    # Bubble sort logic and DOM step generation
└── README.md    # Project documentation
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open index.html in your browser.
4. Click Generate Array to create a random array.
5. Click Sort Array to visualize the bubble sort process.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm
- Managing nested loops and comparison logic
- Tracking algorithm state across iterations
- Dynamically generating and manipulating DOM elements
- Separating algorithm logic from UI rendering
- Handling edge cases and state cleanup between user actions
- Debugging test-driven requirements and matching expected step counts
- Understanding how algorithm “steps” translate to visual representations
