# Build a Customer Complaint Form

**Description:**  
This project is a practice lab from the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum focused on building custom form validation logic using vanilla JavaScript. The goal of the lab was to create a fully functional feedback/complaint form that validates each input field without relying on built-in browser validation.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**File Structure:**

```
build-a-customer-complaint-form/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file with structure
├── style.css    # Styles for the page layout
├── script.js    # JavaScript for functionality
└── README.md    # This file
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to `JavaScript/form-validation/build-a-customer-complaint-form/`.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Enter markdown input get the raw HTML and an HTML preview

**Learning Outcomes:**

- How to build form validation from scratch without HTML5 validation.
- How to structure code using objects, helper functions, and loops.
- How to use Object.values(), Object.entries(), and iteration methods (for...of, forEach).
- How to combine validation logic with DOM manipulation cleanly.
- How to debug validation logic, including mapping field names and controlling event flow.
