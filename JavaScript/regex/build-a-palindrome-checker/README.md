# Build a Palindrome checker

**Description:**  
This project is a simple interactive palindrome checker built as part of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum. The application allows the user to enter any word, phrase, or sentence, and determines whether it reads the same forwards and backwards—ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**File Structure:**

```
build-a-palindrome-checker/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file with structure
├── style.css    # Styles for the page layout
├── script.js    # JavaScript for functionality to check if input is a palindrome
└── README.md    # This file
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to `JavaScript/regex/build-a-palindrome-checker/`.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Input a word and click check to see if it's a palindrome.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Using regular expressions to filter and clean strings
- DOM manipulation and event listeners
- Using regex to negate or accept certain values.
