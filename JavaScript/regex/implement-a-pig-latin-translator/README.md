# Implement a Pig Latin Translator

**Description:**  
Pig Latin is a way of altering English words by following specific transformation rules.

This challenge focuses on building a Pig Latin translator in JavaScript. The goal is to take an English word or sentence, identify the position of its first vowel, and convert it into Pig Latin according to standard rules:

**Technologies Used:**

- JavaScript

**File Structure:**

```
implement-a-pig-latin-translator/
├── script.js    # Using proper regex pattern to convert a string to pig latin.
└── README.md    # This file
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Run the script in your browser console or Node.js:

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Using regular expressions to detect vowel positions in a word
- Applying string methods such as slice(), split(), and join()
- Working with array methods like .map() to transform each word in a sentence
- Implementing conditional logic to handle different translation rules
- Practicing functional programming patterns with method chaining
- Strengthening understanding of text parsing and manipulation in JavaScript
