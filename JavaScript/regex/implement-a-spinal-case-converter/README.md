# Implement a Spinal Case Converter

**Description:**  
Spinal case is a string format where all words are in lowercase and separated by hyphens. "this-is-spinal-tap" is an example of a string in spinal case.

In this lab, you will create a function that converts a given string to spinal case.

**Technologies Used:**

- JavaScript

**File Structure:**

```
build-a-regex-sandbox/
├── script.js    # Using proper regex patterns to create spinal case strings
└── README.md    # This file
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your code editor.
3. Run the script in your browser console or Node.js:

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Using regular expressions to detect word boundaries and format strings
- Converting camelCase, spaces, and underscores into a unified format (spinal case)
- Applying regex capture groups to insert spacing before capital letters
- Normalizing text by replacing multiple character types with a single delimiter
- Chaining string methods for clean, readable transformations
- Writing reusable functions that handle many input variations
