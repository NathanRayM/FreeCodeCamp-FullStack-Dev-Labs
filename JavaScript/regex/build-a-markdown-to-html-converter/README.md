# Build a Markdown to HTML Converter

**Description:**  
Markdown is a markup language used to add formatting elements to plain-text documents. For this lab, all the HTML and CSS has been provided to you. You will use JavaScript to complete the Markdown to HTML Converter app so that it can handle the conversion of basic Markdown constructs into HTML elements.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**File Structure:**

```
build-a-palindrome-checker/
├── index.html   # Main HTML file with structure
├── style.css    # Styles for the page layout
├── script.js    # JavaScript for functionality
└── README.md    # This file
```

**Setup / How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to `JavaScript/regex/build-a-markdown-to-html-converter/`.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Enter markdown input get the raw HTML and an HTML preview

**Learning Outcomes:**

- Apply regular expressions (Regex) to detect and transform Markdown syntax such as headings, bold, italic, links, images, and blockquotes.
- Understand anchoring in Regex using ^ and gm flags to correctly match syntax only at the start of a line.
- Differentiate between DOM-updating logic and returned function values, ensuring compatibility with FreeCodeCamp’s automated test suite.
- Implement dynamic text processing using JavaScript string methods like .replace() with capture groups.
- Build a responsive user interface that displays Markdown input, raw HTML output, and a live HTML preview.
- Use event listeners to trigger real-time conversion as the user types.
- Structure code for clarity and maintainability, separating input handling, conversion logic, and output rendering.
